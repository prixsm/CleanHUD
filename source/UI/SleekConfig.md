# CleanHUD + SleekConfig

CleanHUD's in-game settings are now registered with the separate
[SleekConfig](https://github.com/pedrolecio/SleekConfig) GTA SA settings menu.
CleanHUD does **not** include its own ImGui renderer or window hooks.

## Installing

1. Install CleanHUD as usual (GTA SA PC 1.0 US, Win32 ASI loader).
2. Install the separate `SleekConfig.asi` from the SleekConfig release,
   following SleekConfig's Mod Loader installation instructions.
3. Launch GTA SA, press **F10**, choose **CleanHUD** under Visuals.

If SleekConfig is not installed, CleanHUD runs normally using CleanHUD.ini,
without an F10 configuration panel or error.

## Live editing

Controls cover General (Stack/Minimal, Clock, optional slide),
Visibility (fade and show duration), Elements, Weapon & Ammo and
Advanced Layout. The Advanced Layout page is divided into Clock, Money,
Wanted, Status Bars and Individual spacing groups.

Edits run on the game main thread through SleekConfig's change callback.
CleanHUD's HUDSettings instance is changed directly, so ordinary HUD updates
apply the value immediately; **no ASI/game restart** is needed. Editing a
spacing value does not force hidden HUD elements to be visible: trigger the
relevant Money/Wanted/status/Weapon/Ammo event to preview placement.

SleekConfig owns the F10 hotkey and handles player input, keyboard/mouse,
Direct3D9 render hooks and graphics-device lifecycle. CleanHUD does not
register duplicate F10/D3D9 hooks.

## Persistence and precedence

CleanHUD loads `CleanHUD.ini` on startup, even without SleekConfig.

When SleekConfig is installed, its persisted
`SleekConfig/prixsm.cleanhud.dat` overrides matching INI settings.
That precedence is part of SleekConfig's current upstream design:

1. Registered defaults.
2. CleanHUD.ini values.
3. Saved SleekConfig DAT overrides.

Click **Save Mod** in SleekConfig to save **both** the current CleanHUD.ini
and SleekConfig's DAT snapshot. CleanHUD's existing Win32 `Save()` method
writes the named INI settings while SleekConfig saves its own .dat file.
A failed INI write aborts SleekConfig's Save action.

**Manual INI edits made while an older SleekConfig DAT exists may not take
effect** because DAT takes priority. To restore INI-driven values, remove the
CleanHUD DAT override while the game is closed, then relaunch.

**Restore Saved** reloads the INI baseline, then applies saved DAT values
(where available). **Defaults** restores the registered CleanHUD defaults
as live, unsaved values until the next Save Mod.

No automatic migration of previously saved standalone-editor settings is
needed because both editors use the same CleanHUD.ini keys.

## Build

CleanHUD only vendors the two small SleekConfig API headers and its MIT
license under `third_party/sleekconfig/`; it no longer builds Dear ImGui or
its backends. No `SleekConfig.lib` or additional linker dependency is needed.
The `SleekConfig_GetApi` entry point is resolved dynamically from the
separately installed SleekConfig.asi. Registration retries on the main thread
if SleekConfig becomes available later.

Integration API tested against the public SleekConfig v1 headers, main branch,
October 2026. Target: GTA San Andreas PC 1.0 US, Win32.

## Regression tests to perform in game

- Start without SleekConfig. Game/menu text, loading, TAB, both HUD modes,
  firing and fading behave as before. CleanHUD.ini is loaded.
- Start with SleekConfig. F10 opens **only** SleekConfig; CleanHUD is listed
  under Visuals with 32 controls across five pages.
- Change each group of sliders/checkboxes, especially Stack/Minimal, the
  four Clock gaps and Status Bar to Weapon. Layout updates during play.
- Save Mod, exit/restart, verify the modified CleanHUD.ini and
  SleekConfig/prixsm.cleanhud.dat. Verify saved values on restart.
- Reload/Restore Saved and Defaults behavior, including the DAT precedence
  documented above.
- Verify float values such as 27.5 and 0.25 can be edited without rounding
  to integer values; fade/duration ranges accept 0 to 2000/60000.
- Test with other SleekConfig-enabled mods: there should be one shared F10
  panel, no duplicate D3D9 hook and no stuck mouse or player controls.
- Verify New Game/Load Game startup (no HUD flash), main-menu labels,
  existing vehicle drive-by/vision-goggle behavior and TAB preview.
